            <h1>LUCY GRAY</h1>
            <h3>By Willium Wordsworth</h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>I had heard of Lucy Gray: and, when i crossed the Wild,</p>
            <p>I chanced to see at break of day the solitary Child.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>No Mate, no comrade Lucy knew; She dwelt on a wide Moor,</p>
            <p>The sweetest thing that ever grew beside a human door!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>You yet may spy the Fawn at play, the hare upon the Green;</p>
            <p>But the sweet face of Lucy Gray will never more be seen.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>To-night will be a stormy nighht you to the town must go;</p>
            <p>And take a lantern, child, to light your mother through the snow.</p>
